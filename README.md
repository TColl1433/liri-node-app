# liri-node-app

In this homework assignment we were asked to create a Command Line Interface node app that can take in parameters
and gives data back based on the user input.

Using the .env file we are able to keep our API keys hidden from users and from github using the .gitignore file.

The node modules are also stored in the .gitignore file.

the keys.js file grabs the api keys from the .env file  and exports them. We can then access these in our liri.js file using "require" and they can be stored in a variable so that we can access them later in the code when accessing api keys.

In order to access the keys I used a switch statement, this is really handy because it can be accessed later in the code 
in the spotify and movie functions.
